# The Terraform Dir
Wouldn't it be cool if you could just run a terraform

and have a lambda built, have an api gateway built,

and then have them connected so you can "just run it"

and be done? Yeah it would. Here ya go.

and.

## That's it.

There is nothing else. This is just me using Terraform to build the infra in the cloud to run little lamby.
